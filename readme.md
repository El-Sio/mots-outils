# Monkey Jump
>Simple Infinite scrolling game using phaser 3

This is a Typpescript game build with Phaser 3 and the Typescript + Vite.js template.

The game structure is composed of a home screen with a simple audio toggle button, and a play button leadong to the main scene.
In the main scene, platforms are randomly created from right to left and the player jumps across them collecting items (bananas) and avoiding enemies (parrots and statues)

The game is live at https://japansio.info/monkey

Below is the original readme of the template.

This is a TypeScript specific fork of [phaser3-vite-template](https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-vite-template).

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

It is highly recommended to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) to install Node.js and npm.

For Windows users there is [Node Version Manager for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

Install Node.js and `npm` with `nvm`:

```bash
nvm install node

nvm use node
```

Replace 'node' with 'latest' for `nvm-windows`.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository or use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to scaffold the project like this:

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-typescript-vite-template my-folder-name
cd my-folder-name

npm install
```

Start development server:

```
npm run start
```

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

Production files will be placed in the `dist` folder. Then upload those files to a web server. ðŸŽ‰

## Project Structure

```
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ dist
    â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
    â”œâ”€â”€ public
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HelloWorldScene.ts
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts
	â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
```

TypeScript files are intended for the `src` folder. `main.ts` is the entry point referenced by `index.html`.

Other than that there is no opinion on how you should structure your project.

There is an example `HelloWorldScene.ts` file that can be placed inside a `scenes` folder to organize by type or elsewhere to organize by function. For example, you can keep all files specific to the HelloWorld scene in a `hello-world` folder.

It is all up to you!

## Static Assets

Any static assets like images or audio files should be placed in the `public` folder. It'll then be served from the root. For example: http://localhost:8000/images/my-image.png

Example `public` structure:

```
    public
    â”œâ”€â”€ images
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ my-image.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ music
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ sfx
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

They can then be loaded by Phaser with `this.image.load('my-image', 'images/my-image.png')`.

# TypeScript ESLint

This template uses a basic `typescript-eslint` set up for code linting.

It does not aim to be opinionated.

[See here for rules to turn on or off](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

## Dev Server Port

You can change the dev server's port number by modifying the `vite.config.ts` file. Look for the `server` section:

```js
{
	// ...
	server: { host: '0.0.0.0', port: 8000 },
}
```

Change 8000 to whatever you want.
